# Social.Moyo - a Social Networking Web application

One of the defining characteristics of Gen Z is their ability to navigate and use social media effectively. They have a keen understanding of how to use social media to build personal brands and online communities. They also use social media as a platform to express their opinions on social and political issues and connect with like-minded individuals.

Keeping this mind, we took the time to explore the nitty gritty of a typical social networking platform and dive deep into the possibility of incorporating effective data structures into this project.

This project is a social networking platform, where you can:

- Register yourself as an user
- Follow and un-follow people
- Create posts
- like posts
- delete posts
- Logout any time you want
